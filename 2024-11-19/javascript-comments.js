// In JavaScript, there are two types of comments:

// Single-line comments start with //

// Multi-line or inline comments start with /* and end with */

// The input will be a sequence of //, /* and */. Every /* must have a */ that immediately follows it. To add, there can be no single-line comments in between multi-line comments in between the /* and */.

// Create a function that returns True if comments are properly formatted, and False otherwise.

function commentsCorrect(input) {
  return false;
}
